Questions I Explored in This Project 📊🧠

1. How can I load my dataset from a CSV file and assign meaningful column names to it?
2. What do the first few and last few rows of my dataframe look like, and what initial patterns can I observe?
3. How many total rows and columns does my dataset contain?
4. How many non-null values exist in each column, and does this reveal anything about data completeness?
5. Which tags have the highest total number of posts, and how can I rank them from most to least popular?
6. How many times does each tag appear in the dataset when I count occurrences instead of summing post values?
7. What data type is my Date column, and how can I convert it into proper datetime format for time-series analysis?
8. How can I reshape the dataset so that each date becomes a row, each tag becomes a column, and post counts fill the table?
9. After reshaping, what does the new table look like in terms of dimensions, column names, and completeness?
10.How can I plot a time-series line chart that shows the posting trend of every tag across all dates?
11.How can I smooth the time-series lines using a rolling mean to better visualize long-term trends without noise?

Data Science – Real-World Mini Projects 🚀📊

Welcome to Data Science – Real-World Mini Projects, a collection of real-world data science tasks that I have worked on.
This repository reflects my hands-on practice with real datasets, and complete end-to-end analytical workflows 🧪🧠.

I created these projects as part of my learning journey—revising core concepts, strengthening my fundamentals, and building practical experience. Each mini project represents a small but meaningful step in improving my ability to solve real-world data problems with clarity and confidence 💡✨.
